Unreleased
----------

Any changes which are committed, but not yet present in a released
version, should appear here.

1.10.0 - Wed, Apr 9, 2025
-------------------------

- Several improvements to the library of bash variables & functions available to
  tasks:

  - Oracle Linux version (``$ORAVER``) detection is improved - it now supports
    OL10 and any future version.
  - Added detection for Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and Arch.
  - Added variable ``$PKGMGR`` which refers to the system package manager
  - Added function ``PKG_INSTALL`` which runs the correct installation command
    for the system package manager.

- A major improvement to Yo tasks in general:

  - Tasks may now include files from the client system onto the instance. See
    the documentation for ``INCLUDE_FILE`` and ``SENDFILE`` for more details on
    this quite useful feature.
  - Tasks are now loaded and checked prior to ``yo launch`` so that errors are
    detected before the instance is available. As a result, Yo's task execution
    plan is now also printed with ``yo launch --dry-run``.

- Built on the new functionality in Yo's tasks, we have also added the argument
  ``yo launch --install`` (or just ``-I``). This allows you to list
  comma or space separated package names, which will be installed to your
  instance at startup. This is achieved with a dynamically generated task named
  ``yo-install-packages`` which uses the new ``PKG_INSTALL`` function.
- Create RPM package (OL9 and later are supported)
- Add the ability to tag images from a specific compartment so that they don't
  pollute the existing namespace of operating systems.
- Drop & vendor unnecessary dependencies (to support RPM packaging)

1.9.0 - Wed, Apr 2, 2025
------------------------

-  Added “PREREQ_FOR” relationship for tasks.
-  Improved the operation of ``yo task join`` and other commands that
   wait for task completion.
-  Fixed the drgn task to install drgn without enabling EPEL.
-  Removed “test-” tasks from the Yo task directory.
-  Bug fix: whenever configs are modified, Yo now invalidates its cache.

1.8.1 - Tue, Feb 18, 2025
-------------------------

-  Fixed an issue with renaming an instance when there is a terminated
   instance of the same name.
-  Included updated ZSH completions, thanks to @rpigott again!

1.8.0 - Fr, Nov 22, 2024
------------------------

-  Yo now automatically disables the less secure, legacy `IMDS v1
   endpoints <https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/gettingmetadata.htm#upgrading-v2>`__
   by default. The configuration ``allow_legacy_imds_endpoints`` and
   corresponding ``--allow-legacy-imds-endpoints`` flag for
   ``yo launch`` have been added to disable this feature, but in most
   situations there should be no reason to change this.
-  A new, experimental command called ``yo script`` allows you to write
   a Python script using Yo’s helpers. Some of Yo’s internals have been
   refactored in a way to make it easier to do basic operations like
   launching an instance programatically. Please note that the internal
   APIs of Yo aren’t considered stable, so future updates may break
   compatibility with such scripts.
-  OCI Service Errors are now caught and handled in a slightly nicer
   way. While a traceback is still shown, we try to de-emphasize it, and
   show the actual OCI error message. This way, users may be able to
   easily see what went wrong, in case it was a user error rather than
   Yo client error.
-  Add some code to handle rate-limiting from the OCI API by backing
   off, in the ``yo list --ip`` command.
-  Boot volumes can now be attached and detached.
-  Improved zsh completion scripts, courtesy of @rpigott.

1.7.3 - Wed, Sep 11, 2024
-------------------------

-  Fixed crash in ``yo images`` parsing an OS value without colon.
-  Added user-friendly catch for a common error: adding a comment at the
   end of a ``~/.oci/yo.ini`` value.

1.7.2 - Mon, Sep 9, 2024
------------------------

-  Added zsh completion script, thanks @rpigott!
-  Fixed race condition in launching tasks on some ``ssh`` / OS
   versions.
-  Fixed copy/paste error in argument description of
   ``yo compat --image-names``

1.7.1 - Fri, Aug 30, 2024
-------------------------

-  Fixed a cache contamination bug when switching between OCI regions.
-  ``yo cache-clean`` now cleans caches from all region, and the old
   legacy cache
-  Allow extensions to customize the default config file.
-  Improve the initial configuration phases a bit.

1.7.0 - Thu, Aug 29, 2024
-------------------------

-  Yo now has support for multiple OCI regions!

   -  Previously, if you wanted to run yo against another OCI region,
      you needed to edit your config, run ``yo cache-clean``, and then
      run your commands.
   -  Now, Yo allows you to store configuration for several OCI regions
      into your config. You set a default region in your config file,
      but you can override it with the ``YO_REGION`` environment
      variable, or ``yo -r REGION`` on the command line.
   -  Please see the documentation for a migration guide:
      https://oracle.github.io/yo/guide/region.html#migrating-yo-ini-to-multi-region-support

-  Switched Yo’s default setup dialog to use ``oci setup keys``. Updated
   documentation accordingly.
-  Yo can now use OCI API keys which have a passphrase. It will
   automatically detect that a passphrase is required, and prompt only
   when attempting to use the API. Since many API results are cached,
   prompts aren’t terribly frequent.
-  The Yo image list now uses “natural sort”. This ensures that images
   with numbers like “8.10” sort after “8.9”, which is important if you
   have an operating system image with that version number :P

1.6.0 - Wed, Apr 17, 2024
-------------------------

New Features:

-  The ``yo list`` command now has a completely configurable table.

   -  Columns may be specified as a list in the config file
      (``list_columns``)
   -  An alternative list may be specified via ``yo list -C a,b,c``
   -  Columns can be added to the end of the table with
      ``yo list -x Column``

-  The ``yo list`` command includes a new column, ``ResourceType``,
   which corresponds to the value of the
   ``Oracle-Recommended-Tags.ResourceType`` tag.

1.5.1 - Tue, Apr 9, 2024
------------------------

Another tiny release, which I configure a “bugfix release”.

Fixes:

-  Fixed a crash with ``yo nmi``
-  Added ``--ad`` option to ``yo launch`` which was a bit of an
   oversight

1.5.0 - Mon, Feb 5, 2024
------------------------

This is a very tiny release with just three changes.

New Features:

-  The “yo attach” and “yo detach” commands now work with boot volumes.

Fixes:

-  Allow “yo teardown” operation to occur in states other than RUNNING.
   Specifically, it should be possible to teardown STOPPED instances.
   The operation isn’t permitted in TERMINATED or TERMINATING states.
-  Respect the termination protection option for “yo teardown”.
   Previously, “yo teardown” would happily terminate a protected
   instance.

1.4.0 - Fri, Dec 15, 2023
-------------------------

This version of Yo comes with some major improvements.

New Features:

-  Two new instance actions are added: “teardown” and “rebuild”. The
   teardown operation terminates the instance, but preserves the boot
   volume, and attaches some metadata to the instance so that Yo will
   know how to rebuild it the way it was. The “rebuild” operation does
   exactly that.

   -  This operation might be preferred instead of “stop” and “start” in
      cases where your tenancy is encountering service limits. Stopped
      instances still count toward your service limits, while terminated
      instances do not.
   -  Please note that for now, “teardown” cannot remember what block
      volumes were attached to your instance, and so “rebuild” will not
      reattach block volumes (aside from the boot volume, of course).
      This feature could be added if there is demand for it.

-  You may now specify a custom username for your instances! This can be
   specified in your instance profile configuration, or on the
   ``yo launch`` command line. Yo will automatically keep track of the
   username for each instance using a tag, so you don’t need to remember
   which you chose. So the existing ``yo ssh`` commands will work
   regardless of your username choice.
-  You may now specify a boot volume to launch an instance from. If you
   terminated a volume with (``--preserve-root``), then you can launch
   an instance from the same boot volume. This operation is similar to
   “rebuild”, except that you must manually specify the instance shape,
   name, etc.
-  There is a new command, ``yo copy-id``, which wraps ``ssh-copy-id``.
   Use it to copy SSH keys over to an instance. For the most part, you
   shouldn’t need this because Yo passes your key in anyway, but it
   could be useful to add more keys.

Changes:

-  The default configuration of Yo now specifies the
   ``VM.Standard.x86.Generic`` shape with 1 CPU and 8 GiB of memory.
-  The ``yo list`` command no longer shows instances in ``TERMINATING``
   state.
-  The ``yo -h`` help output is now organized into logical categories
   with well-written command summaries.
-  Documentation for each Yo sub-command is now automatically generated
   to match the CLI.
-  Sub-commands are now permitted: commands like ``yo volume-list`` are
   now ``yo   volume list``. However, the old spellings are still
   permitted, as we don’t want to break anybody’s muscle memory.
-  Yo’s command aliasing is now improved. Prior to this release, Yo used
   shortest-prefix aliasing, but if you wanted to specify your own alias
   mapping, then shortest-prefix mappings were disabled. This limitation
   has now been removed. If you specify custom aliases, then Yo will use
   them, and will still create shortest-prefix aliases for the rest of
   the commands.

Fixes:

-  Fixes an error due to a missing minimum version of the ``rich``
   library.
-  If you have provided memory / cpu configurations in an instance
   profile, but you then override the profile with a non-flex shape, Yo
   used to raise an error. However, this isn’t a very helpful error:
   it’s clear the user wants the non-flex shape and forgot about the
   default flex configuration. So we’ve removed this unnecessary error.

1.3.1 - Wed, Sept 6, 2023
-------------------------

Fixes:

-  Fix ``FileExistsError`` on Windows.

1.3.0 - Fri, Sept 1, 2023
-------------------------

Changes:

-  The look & feel of Yo has been updated a bit. Progress bars have been
   removed in favor of spinners, since we can’t accurately predict
   progress most of the time anyway. The spinners also show the time
   elapsed even after completion, so that you know how long Yo spent
   waiting for each action. Most of the printouts now also include a
   timestamp.
-  Yo now catches Ctrl-C gracefully and exits without a traceback.
-  The ``creator_tags`` configuration option is added. This
   configuration is related to how Yo tracks instances which you’ve
   created. If Yo is already working for you, there’s no need to care
   about it.

Fixes:

-  Fixed some bugs related to parsing information in InstanceProfile.
-  Fixed a very rare bug related to the automatic update checking.
-  Fixed a bug related to the default configuration of memory for
   flexible CPU instances.

1.2.0 - Wed, Aug 9, 2023
------------------------

New features:

-  Add ``yo launch --wait-ssh``, which waits for SSH to come up, but
   doesn’t actually connect you to SSH.
-  Add ``yo list --ip``, which adds an IP address column for
   ``yo list``.
-  Improved the speed of IP address lookups, when loading IPs for
   several instances at a time (e.g. ``yo list --ip`` or ``yo ip``).
-  Add ``yo list --all``, which prints info about all instances in the
   compartment, not just your own. Yo still is not capable of managing
   these instances, it is just an informational view.
-  The short argument ``-E`` is now usable in place of ``--exact-name``.
-  The ``--exact-name -E`` arguments are now added to the block volume
   management commands. They apply both to the name of the instance, and
   the block volume.
-  A new configuration, ``exact_name``, is added to the ``yo.ini``. This
   has the effect of implying ``--exact-name`` on every command without
   you needing to type it.
-  A new argument, ``--no-exact-name``, allows you to override
   ``exact_name = true`` in your configuration on a case-by-case basis.
-  A new configuration, ``resource_filtering``, is added to ``yo.ini``.
   This allows Yo to view and manage all resources in your compartment,
   not just the ones you’ve created. This is not a recommended
   configuration, please be careful when using this.
-  During ``yo list``, Yo will now automatically check for newer
   versions in the background. If it finds a newer version, it will
   print a notice. As a default, the version checks are a minimum of 6
   hours apart, but this can be configured with the config
   ``check_for_update_every``. Setting the configuration to 0 will
   disable the feature.

Changes:

-  ``yo list`` now sorts your instances by creation time, rather than
   the default (presumably undefined) ordering returned by the API.

Fixes:

-  A rare issue with concurrent accesses to the Yo cache has been
   resolved. Cache updates are now atomic.
-  Yo now refreshes the instance list prior to running the start, stop,
   reboot, terminate commands. This ensures that it is operating on the
   correct set of instances, avoiding rare but important caching bugs.
-  Improved error messages that occur when looking up an instance by
   name, so that the message includes the actual instance that Yo tried
   to search for (as impacted by ``--exact-name``).
-  Fixed a compatibility issue with Windows due to the use of “fchmod()”
-  Fixed a silly bug in which ``yo cache-clean`` failed if the cache
   file does not exist.

1.1.0 - Tue, July 18, 2023
--------------------------

-  Yo now adds the freeform tag:
   ``{"yo-created-by": "your.email@example.com"}`` to every instance it
   launches.

   -  In cases where the tenancy does not automatically add a
      ``Oracle-Tags.CreatedBy`` tag, we fall back to the above freeform
      tag to identify instances launched by the current Yo user.
   -  If the ``Oracle-Tags.CreatedBy`` tag is not present on instances
      in your tenancy, Yo prints a loud warning with more information.
      You can silence this warning by setting
      ``silence_automatic_tag_warning = true`` in the config.

-  Yo can now handle instances of ``Oracle-Tags.CreatedBy`` which
   contain a prefix ending in a slash (``/``) before the email address.

1.0.4 - Mon, June 5, 2023
-------------------------

-  Bugfix release for the extension API changes in 1.0.3.

1.0.3 - Fri, June 2, 2023
-------------------------

-  A minor change to an internal extension API, which was omitted in
   1.0.2.

.. _fri-june-2-2023-1:

1.0.2 - Fri, June 2, 2023
-------------------------

-  The SSH options added in 1.0.1 have been updated to improve
   compatibility with older SSH versions. If you encountered the
   following error during a ``yo   console``, then it’s likely this fix
   will resolve your issue:

   ::

      command-line: line 0: Bad configuration option: pubkeyacceptedalgorithms

-  Yo no longer crashes when encountering an instance with multiple VNIC
   attachments. Instead, it just warns that it is blindly taking the
   first VNIC. We’ll need more user feedback to inform the correct
   behavior.

1.0.1 - Tue, May 9, 2023
------------------------

-  Yo is now located at ``https://github.com/oracle/yo``, and
   documentation is now located at ``https://oracle.github.io/yo/``.
   This will be its permanent home, please update any bookmarks.
-  Some SSH options have been added for the Instance Console Connection,
   in order to make it work on newer OpenSSH versions.
-  The documentation has been improved in a few places: namely regarding
   SSH configuration.

1.0.0 - Tue, April 18, 2023
---------------------------

This is the initial public release of Yo! It’s the culmination of 26
minor internal releases over 2.5 years, and we’re pleased to present it
to the public.
