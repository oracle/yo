# Multiple OCI Region Support in Yo

OCI's services are spread across datacenters in many regions. Most OCI resources
are specific to one OCI region, such as instances and block devices. Further,
the OCI API is region-specific, and the OCI web console only shows resources
from a single region at a time.

Yo's functionality is similar. Any Yo command can only run against a single
region (e.g. `yo list` will only show instances of a specific region). By
default, Yo runs in the region configured by the `region` key in the `[yo]`
section of `yo.ini`. However, with proper configuration, you can override the
region that Yo runs in with `yo -r REGION ...` for any sub-command.

## Configuring multiple regions

Each region you would like to use must have its own VCN and subnet information
configured, within a region-specific configuration section. For example:

```
[regions.us-ashburn-1]
vcn_id = ocid.vcn...
subnet_id = ocid.subnet...

[regions.us-phoenix-1]
vcn_id = ocid.vcn...
subnet_id = ocid.subnet...
```

## Using multiple regions

The default region is selected via the `region` configuration key in the `[yo]`
section. This may be overridden on the command line using `yo -r REGION`. The
`-r` flag _must_ be immediately after the `yo` command and before the
sub-command. For example:

```bash
# CORRECT:
yo -r us-ashburn-1 list

# INCORRECT
yo list -r us-ashburn-1
```

If you'd like to run an entire shell session using a specific Yo region, you may
set the `YO_REGION` environment variable, which Yo will detect and use. The
environment variable may be overridden by the command line option.

## Migrating yo.ini to multi-region support

Upon upgrading Yo, you may see the following warning:

```
warning: region-specific configurations in [yo] section are deprecated, please update your config to use [regions.*] sections
```

To resolve this warning, make the following changes to your `~/.oci/yo.ini`
configuration file:

1. You should already have a line `region = something` in your configuration.
   We'll refer to this value as `$REGION` here. First, create a new section
   beneath the `[yo]` section named `[regions.$REGION]`
2. Move the configuration keys `vcn_id` and `subnet_id` (or
   `subnet_compartment_id`, if you use that instead) into the
   `[regions.$REGION]` section.
3. Optionally, update your availability domain configurations in each instance
   profile to refer to the AD by number, rather than name.

For example, consider this (incomplete) configuration snippet:

```ini
[yo]
instance_compartment_id = ocid1.compartment...
region = us-ashburn-1
vcn_id = ocid1.vcn...
subnet_id = ocid1.subnet...
my_email = example@example.com
my_username = example

[instances.DEFAULT]
availability_domain = VkEH:US-ASHBURN-AD-1
shape = VM.Standard.x86.Generic
cpu = 1
mem = 8
os = Oracle Linux:9
name = ol9-1
```

The updated configuration would look like this:

```ini
[yo]
instance_compartment_id = ocid1.compartment...
region = us-ashburn-1
my_email = example@example.com
my_username = example

[regions.us-ashburn-1]
vcn_id = ocid1.vcn...
subnet_id = ocid1.subnet...

[instances.DEFAULT]
availability_domain = 1
shape = VM.Standard.x86.Generic
cpu = 1
mem = 8
os = Oracle Linux:9
name = ol9-1
```

Now, you may add more region configurations (each with its own section), and you
can easily switch between these regions on the command line.
