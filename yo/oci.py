Things requiring OCI import

TODO: this module was created as a hack around how slooooowly the OCI module
loads. It turns out that this is because OCI imports every single service when
you run "import oci", unless you set an environment variable to disable this
(silly) behavior:

https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/python/2.79.0/sdk_behaviors/enable_selective_service_imports.html

We now set this environment variable in yo.main.main, and since the yo.oci
module is lazily loaded (very much on purpose), that will take effect before any
of the imports here.

However, the 100 milliseconds it takes to load the relevant OCI modules probably
aren't important, so the design decision to stuff all the OCI imports into a
separate module is no longer a great one. In the future, I may get rid of this
monstrosity and need to set the environment variable at the top of the script.
